{% for copy in book.bookinstance_set.all %}
 code to iterate across each copy/instance of a book 
{% endfor %}

This method is needed because you declare a ForeignKey (one-to many) field only in the "many" side of the relationship (the BookInstance). 
Since you don't do anything to declare the relationship in the other ("one") model, it (the Book) doesn't have any field to get the set of associated records. 
To overcome this problem, Django constructs an appropriately named "reverse lookup" function that you can use. The name of the function is constructed by 
lower-casing the model name where the ForeignKey was declared, followed by _set (i.e. so the function created in Book is bookinstance_set()).

Beware also that if you don't define an order (on your class-based view or model), you will also see errors from the development server like this one:

That happens because the paginator object expects to see some ORDER BY being executed on your underlying database. 
Without it, it can't be sure the records being returned are actually in the right order!
